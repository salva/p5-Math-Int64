       - multiplication of uint64 values was broken for very large

        - several fixes for MS compiler (bug reports and testing by
          bulk88 at PerlMonks)
        - native_to_uint64 was broken

0.19  Jun 1, 2012
        - do not overflow on shifts

          corrected
        - add support for as_int64 and as_uint64 callbacks
        - make native_if_available a lexical pragma, there is some
          risk of breaking old code using this pragma selectively on
