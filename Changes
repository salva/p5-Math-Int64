0.24  Jun 5, 2012
       - workaround bug on old MS compilers not implementing
         NV->uint64_t conversions and silently using NV->int64_t
         instead

0.23  Jun 4, 2012
       - multiplication of uint64 values was broken for very large
         operands
       - place local variables inside PREINIT blocks in XS code

0.22  Jun 4, 2012
       - more fixes for MS compiler
       - test for uint64 to NV conversions added

0.21  Jun 4, 2012 
       - make other and rev arguments optional for overloading methods
         when possible so that they can be called directly

0.20  Jun 3, 2012
        - several fixes for MS compiler (bug reports and testing by
          bulk88 at PerlMonks)
        - native_to_uint64 was broken

0.19  Jun 1, 2012
        - do not overflow on shifts
        - add limits constants

0.18_04  Dec 25, 2011

          corrected
        - add support for as_int64 and as_uint64 callbacks
        - make native_if_available a lexical pragma, there is some
          risk of breaking old code using this pragma selectively on
          5.8.x perls
        - doc improvements

0.18_02  Dec 20, 2011
        - make it run in perls 5.8, 5.10 and 5.12

0.15  May 27, 2011

          functions not available on perls older than 5.10 are now
          used.

0.14  May 27, 2011
        - add support for 64bit random number generation
        - selectively import subs from Math::Int64 or from ...::Native

        - require perl 5.8.x

0.10  Feb 8, 2011
        - solved bug in uint64_to_number

0.09  Oct 23, 2009

        - some bit operations were broken (bug report by Adam Woodworth)

0.04  Sep 10, 2009
        - make it work under Strawberry Perl and probably other perl
          Windows ports! (bug report and patch by Sisyphus)

0.03  Apr 5, 2007
        - use SvIOK_UV instead of SvUOK (that's not supported in older
          perls)
        - int64_to_net and uint64_to_net were only accepting
          Math::U?Int64 objects
